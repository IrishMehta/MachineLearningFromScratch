    "### Basics-\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Tokens are numerical mappings of the text. They can be characters, sub-words, combinations of characters and subwords, etc\n",
    "    When tokenizing text,  each sentence will be 1 batch. If you want multiple batches, create a list of sentences\n",
    "2) Embeddings are vector space representations of tokens. An embdedding space essentially has a mapping of tokens to embeddings (vectors) through a logic-\n",
    "    Embedding layer syntax: nn.Embedding(num_embeddings=vocab_size, embedding_dim= embedding_dim)\n",
    "    Here, we define the embedding dimensions, i.e to what dimension we want to map our text- and we generally call it hidden size as it is the dimension of the space that is hidden from the user\n",
    "    Vocab size is also defined by us if we use a custom tokenizer, but a standard one will already have a vocab_size mapped\n",
    "3) Scaled Dot product attention\n",
    "4) Single head attention-\n",
    "- What is independent attention mechanism?\n",
    "    - It is a projection of the input embeddings into a low dimension space represented by head_dim, and it learns one specific feature of the sequence (like subject verb, active passive etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Multihead attention\n",
    "    - each attention head has a linear mapping from embedding dimensions to head dimensions\n",
    "    - This mapping is done on the entire sequence of embedded tokens in each batch\n",
    "    - We use this mapped value (of q,v and k) from the head and compute the similarity between the query and the key and then scale it using softmax\n",
    "    - We use this scaled dot product (attention scores) to take a dot product with the value and give us the updated embeddings that essentially give us the original embedding including some context of the past and future sequence\n",
    "    - After calculating the updated values for one head, we repeat for all heads and then concatenate all heads along the last dimension, which is the head dimension. When we concatenate, we get the original embedding space back, but with added context. we get output with dimensions [batch, sequence, embedding dimensions]\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "6) After getting the output of multihead attention, we first create a transformer encoder layer. First, we add a residual connection (by adding multihead output to original string embeddings)\n",
    "7) We then do a layer normalization (since we did addition) to bring back the embeddings to mean 0. We also stabilize the data for training so that there are no vanishing gradients\n",
    "8) After this, each token embedding goes through a feed forward network\n",
    "    - First mapping is from hidden dimensions (input embedding dimensions) to intermediate dimensions (larger space) to capture nuances\n",
    "    - Next we apply ReLU activation to introduce non linearity to learn complex relationship. If we don't do this, the entire attention model will be based on linear transformations\n",
    "    - The last mapping is converting the input embeddings in intermediate dimension back to the original dimensions (we basically assume that the transformations will incorporate the patterns and relations learned in the higher dimensional space\n",
    "9) We again perform a residual connection (adding feed forward output to original embeddings) and layer normalization\n",
    "    \n",
    "10) After creating the transformer encoder layer, we create a transformer encoder, for which we would need to add positional embeddings so that the transformer knows the position of a particular embedding in a sequence, which can allow it to learn more relations\n",
    "    - To add positional embeddings, we need a way to engineer values such that they are normalized and unique\n",
    "    - We use cos and sin approach for odd and even index values respectively\n",
    "    - Before using the cos and sin functions, we need to calculate a unique normalized number for each position. We create a divisor for all even numbers (we can do it only for odd as well but we don't need to do for both as sin and cos phase shift would take care of it)\n",
    "    - Note that we use cos and sin functions on a multiplication  of divisor with the absolute position (somewhere betwen 0 to max length)\n",
    "    - After adding the cos and sin functions to create positional embeddings, we add it to a buffer so that it doesnt change when model is being trained (as this function will be called multiple times)\n",
    "    - We then add these positional embeddings to the original input embedding vector\n",
    "    - It is definitely mind boggling, I don't get how adding two vectors would help the algo figure out a position. But it seems to be working\n"
